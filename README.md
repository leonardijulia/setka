# setka

setka in Polish means a hundred. It's a simple game for improving your concentration, often used in sports psychology. I personally used it all the time when I was training for National and International climbing competition from the web page of Dariusz Parzelski - a Polish sport psychologist (http://www.psychologsportu.com/setka-game/). Unfortunately the game runs on Flash, which is not supported anymore by most of web browsers, hence I decided to write my own setka game to be able to keep practicing my mental game and my coding game. The interface etc. is still under construction. For the game I used the pygame library.
